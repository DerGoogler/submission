# Magisk Modules Alternative Respository Submissions
Just like the official Magisk Modules repository, this is where you can submit your modules.

# Steps
1. Create an issue on this repository with the link to your repo.
2. Wait for a moderator to approve or deny your module.

# Differences
* Instead of only a few moderators, the Alt repository has plenty of volunteers who are constantly reviewing your submissions.
* Device-specific modules **are allowed**.
* "Trivial" modules **are allowed**. This includes simple boot scripts.

# Contact
If you need assistance, feel free to contact any of our Alt repo moderators through email or Telegram.
